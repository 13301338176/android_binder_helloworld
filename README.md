# Hello world example for android binder usage #

This example package illustrates the most usefull binder concepts.

## Binder Intro ##

We split these packages into modules, so we get it really simple to understand the binder mechanism. The most important binder components are:

* binder driver
* binder service manager
* binder service proxy
* binder services
* binder clients(native clients and java clients)

## Packages ##

Here we are going to explore the binder by using these modules:

* native binder client under /client
* binder proxy and binder interface under /libhelloservice
* binder server under /server which provides hello world service for our clients
* [TODO] binder interface from java(AIDL) and java client

* compile these packages
* open emulator/device
